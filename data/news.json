As the first anniversary of his return to Everton approaches, however, that is precisely how Moyes feels. “It has made me go again,” he says of the only job that could have tempted him back to the Premier League frontline. The 62-year-old has mellowed with the years but his incandescent reaction to Michael Keane’s red card – after Wednesday’s game and when Everton’s appeal was rejected on Friday – showed the fire and fight burn as intensely as ever. There could be more eruptions ahead. Continue reading...",

The Austrian declared he was “not David Copperfield” in his first press conference and usually has a saying for whatever situation Palace are in, such as declaring they must not be “one-hit wonders” after winning the FA Cup. It was therefore no surprise to find Glasner had come prepared when he played a straight bat to questions about his future this week after Ruben Amorim’s sacking by Manchester United. “I’m not a gambler,” he said when asked to comment on the fact he is the bookmakers’ favourite to take over at Old Trafford in the summer.
