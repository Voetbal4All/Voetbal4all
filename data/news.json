      "summary": "Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now! Having started this season at Real Madrid with 13 wins from his first 14 games, Xabi Alonso could be forgiven for thinking he was on to a good thing in his new role of Kindergarten Cop, tasked with instilling discipline among the spoilt and unruly brats in his care. While this excellent run was punctuated by a tonking at the hands of Atlético and a diva strop thrown by Vinícius Júnior, Alonso seemed to have pulled off the unthinkable by introducing something approaching a work ethic into a group of players who had previously been powered on ego and vibes. It wasn’t until November that the passengers on board the Madrid wagon began to unscrew the wheels, when a series of poor results led to revelations that all was not well in the camp. Leaks suggested the squad was split between the few players who were entirely sold on the 43-year-old’s ethos and the apparent vast majority who took exception to this José Come-Lately’s tyrannical demands that they turn up on time, run around a bit and occasionally sit through boring tactical presentations that lasted longer than a FaceSpace Snap. The suggestion that Manchester United hve taken/should take advice from Seinfeld [yesterday’s Football Daily] got me thinking. There was an episode about a competition during which, um, refraining from certain personal activities led to a temporary increase in intelligence (note: for male participants only!). As I recall, one of the outcomes was that George Costanza became fluent in Portuguese. Does this explain why the United board hired Messrs Mourinho and Amorim and signed Cristiano Ronaldo in recent years? And, does the hiring of Mr Carrick signal the, um, the end of the competition?” – Mike Wilner. Following Dan Westacott’s letter about JR (yesterday’s letters), surely a growing number of Manchester United’s fans are praying that they will wake up back in 2013, where Sir Alex Ferguson will be getting out of the shower one morning, preparing himself for a press conference when he will announce that he isn’t actually retiring” – Simon Dunsby. Not only did Dan get a letter published with a joke from 40 years ago, but he won letter of the day! And you didn’t even have to look it up! Oh, wait …” – Z Snook. Seriously guys? Only two options and you gave letter of the day to the writer not called Gumley Slats!?!” – Adam Sherlock. This is an extract from our daily football email … Football Daily.
