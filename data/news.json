      "summary": "Today’s rumours need a bit of a stir Most footballers become famous for playing the game but others attract renown for not liking it – foremost among them is Arsenal’s Ben White. Accordingly, it would make sense were he to join David Moyes’s Everton, who are seeking to resolve a problematic right-back situation. The chance to follow in the footsteps of Tony Hibbert, typically a huge pull factor, is nullified because White presumably has no idea who he is. Elsewhere on Merseyside, it appears Liverpool have finally discovered the best way to improve a dodgy defence is not to buss hundreds of millions on attackers, but to have decent defenders. Consequently, they are looking at Como’s Jacobo Ramón – and so too are Chelsea, should the romance of being stockpiled with a 68-year contract prove too alluring to turn down. Continue reading...",

To that end, some members of the Crystal Palace side deservedly beaten by Macclesfield perhaps learned a valuable lesson at Moss Rose. Marc Guéhi and Adam Wharton are linked regularly with big moves away from Palace, but part of succeeding at elite clubs – the pair are admired by Manchester City and Manchester United respectively – is coping with being overwhelming favourites. Oliver Glasner, too, may have designs on bigger things, with United again a possible destination, but to see his side schooled by part-timers was a blow to his burgeoning reputation. Glasner slammed his players after the defeat but the Austrian must take a portion of the blame. They must all do better.
