This FA Cup third-round knockout means the 13-time winners have been dumped from the competition and the League Cup at the first opportunity for a first time since 1981-82. By the end of May, United’s season will stand at a total of 40 games – their lowest number in a complete campaign since 1914-15. If the Carabao Cup penalty shootout elimination at Grimsby in August was dire, this disappointment was as concerningly insipid. Goals from Brajan Gruda and Danny Welbeck, one in each half, (probably) ended Darren Fletcher’s record as the interim manager as winless – this defeat following the draw at Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday.

There were, though, positives to take in the performance of Taty ­Castellanos, the Argentinian striker who scored the Hammers’ winning goal.
