Was Daniel Farke 45 minutes away from the sack? And just how underwhelming a summer signing had Dominic Calvert-Lewin been? As television and radio pundits agreed, the Leeds manager was in a precarious position, something extraordinary was unfolding in the away dressing room at the Etihad Stadium. It was late November and Leeds were trailing 2-0 to Manchester City. While Farke decided the moment had come to rip up his long-preferred setup and switch from a back four and a lone striker to 5-3-2, Calvert-Lewin was not content merely to ready himself for his introduction as a second-half substitute.

But Sudan, who qualified for the tournament despite the tragedy of a horrendous war in their country, certainly match the Lions of Teranga in fortitude. Sudan, coached by the Ghanaian Kwesi Appiah, who led his home country at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, played all their qualifiers away from home, with the war, which began in April 2023, shutting down a thriving domestic league. The Sudan striker John Mano told the BBC of people back home: “Some of them cannot watch the matches … They can’t even listen on the radio … We are trying to free our country, through the football way.” A win for Sudan would be one of the fairytales of the tournament.
