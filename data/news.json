I still won’t listen while he’s on. If you rate him, put him on with Simon Jordan, then you’ll see his intellect. Is he cheap? Is that it? Please explain to me, why? Bob, Kent.” Season’s greetings to you too, Bob. I’ve had worse. Bob’s just curious. The truth is that not everything is for everyone, certainly I am not for Bob in Kent.

Jess Carter has spent her life grappling with when to hold back and when to speak up; wrestling with being naturally herself, embodying the characteristics her parents instilled in her of being open, honest, vocal and confident, and subduing herself because, while society values those traits, in a black woman they can be viewed negatively.

Letting go of that has meant confronting the void left behind Accepting retirement from professional football has felt like stepping into a landscape shaped by loss and uncertainty. Even when the decision is rational, even when the body is signalling that it’s time, there is something profoundly emotional about acknowledging that an era of your life has ended. To me, it felt very much like grief. The shock, sadness, anger, confusion and numbness mirror the emotional responses that accompany any major loss I’ve experienced. But instead of mourning the loss of a loved one, you are mourning the loss of a part of you – a big part. For years football provided direction, belonging, inspiration, purpose and validation. A sense of being part of something bigger. Continue reading...",
