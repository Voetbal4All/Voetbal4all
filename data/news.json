Despite the rare absence of Bruno Fernandes, they jumped above Liverpool after a 1-0 win over Newcastle at Old Trafford last night. A great goal too. I didn’t rate Patrick Dorgu at all until seeing him play for Denmark but he bettered his goal against the Scots with a crunching left-foot volley here. And yet, despite moving to a flat back four – the equivalent of Dylan going electric we were led to believe – it was still highly unconvincing stuff from Ruben Amorim’s men and Newcastle must have been kicking themselves not to have taken at least a draw. Here’s Jamie Jackson’s report. Continue reading...",

Utterly surreal. A home Euros in 2022 had provided wave after wave of emotion, England’s win at Wembley the culmination of decades of growth, setbacks, fight and deep longing. Everyone sang from the same hymn sheet for that maiden Euros win: the written press, broadcasters, fans, sponsors, Football Association, players and Sarina Wiegman and her staff. There were tears – lots. Having begun covering women’s football for the Guardian via a weekly column before the 2017 Euros, then gone full-time before the 2019 World Cup, I felt as if I had lived that progression, journeyed with them, contributed, in some small way, to that growth. The 2025 edition was different, surreal, an almost psychedelic experience. In many ways better than 2022. This was England’s first major tournament win – male or female – away from home. Expectations were high but injuries, retirements and inconsistent performances and results had made most aware that a title defence wouldn’t be a procession. That made it all the more magnificent.
