After travelling supporters had voiced their anger at the goalless draw at Brentford on Thursday, it was the home fans’ turn to vent their frustrations after a result against Sunderland that could easily have been worse. After a promising first-half display and Ben Davies’ opener, this draw will be even more disappointing for Thomas Frank having seen how his team were outplayed after the break by a Sunderland team still heavily depleted by players away on international duty. Brian Brobbey’s 80th-minute equaliser came at a time when the visitors were considerably the better side and perhaps looked like taking all three points. Continue reading...",

      "summary": "Updates from 5.30pm (GMT) kick-off at the Etihad Clockwatch: Fulham v Liverpool, Afcon and more Antoine Semenyo, it seems likely, will soon join Manchester City from Bournemouth for a fee of £65m. Given how well Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden have played from the right this season, it is not immediately obvious why City need him, but the modern game is the modern game, the rammed calendar makes large and flexible squads essential and Pep Guardiola may have some esoteric plan for the Ghanaian anyway. But perhaps what is most striking about the deal is the fee – or, more precisely, how little attention it has drawn. English football has become inured to big transfers. The fee feels about right. Semenyo is 25. He has four and a half years left on his contract. He is quick, skilful, intelligent and works hard. He is disciplined, but has the capacity to do the unexpected. Of course a player of his ability costs that much. Yet £65m would make him the third-most expensive player in Bundesliga history. He would be the seventh-most expensive in Serie A history, the 14th-most expensive in La Liga history. Only nine non-English clubs have paid a fee higher than that. Even in Premier League terms, Semenyo sneaks into the top 25. Continue reading...",

On first glance, a draw away at a ­relegation-threatened, newly ­promoted side does little in terms of oozing positivity. But given the fact Ruben Amorim selected a starting lineup with nine defensive-minded players and the visitors were facing a Leeds side now on their longest unbeaten run in the Premier League since 2001, they will view this as a point gained.
