Who won the Champions League? Women – but we are losing so many.” Cabral has her A Licence but is stuck in limbo. Unable to get on a Pro Licence course that would clear a path to more senior head coach roles in an era when women’s teams are increasingly demanding that qualification, she stepped back to become a No 2 in the US. But after one NWSL season with Utah Royals, she left in December in the hope that expanding her experience at another club would help to open a Pro Licence door. Continue reading...",

Usually, millions of people in Iran follow every step of Taremi’s European career, one that took off with Porto and has settled in Piraeus via Milan, but not this time. The ruling regime in Tehran has cut the internet and all communications, which meant that residents of the football-loving nation also missed the non-celebration that followed. “It actually has to do with the conditions in my country,” Taremi said. “There are problems between the people and the government. The people are always with us, and that’s why we are with them. I couldn’t celebrate in solidarity with the Iranian people. I know that Olympiakos fans would like me to be happy, but I don’t celebrate the goals, in solidarity with what the Iranian people are going through.” Continue reading...",

But the Brazilian journalist Renan Moura reports that people around Paquetá want to persuade him to stay in Europe, and Chelsea could move for him. The future of Marc Guéhi was always likely to be one of the main plotlines of this transfer window, with original suitors Liverpool tussling with Manchester City over the defender’s services as he enters the last six months of his Crystal Palace contract. Arsenal have also shown interest but now entering stage left are Bayern Munich, whose sporting director, Max Erbl, has been having cosy chats with Guéhi’s agent at the Bundesliga champions’ training ground, according to Sky Italia.
