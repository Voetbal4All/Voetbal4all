There’s more of a confidence and belief but that’s only going to come from more results and more performances and being more consistent with what we do. There are certainly certain things that we’ve improved on, but it’s a difficult league, and we came in at a difficult moment, so it was always going to be hard to instantly get those results.

Wilfried Nancy’s appointment as the manager of a team who were serious operators in the Champions League a matter of months earlier will go down as one of the most bamboozling episodes in the history of Scottish football. Nancy used his Friday press conference to plead for time and context. He railed against the media, who presumably continue to err by highlighting his woeful record. By Saturday afternoon, he was wandering down the tunnel as a beaten man. Nancy’s position is untenable. He cannot be the only Celtic employee who exits, such is the scale of calamity. The simple solution for Celtic would be to call Martin O’Neill, who presided over seven victories out of eight while in pre-Nancy caretaker charge. The 73-year-old retains capacity to revive Celtic’s fortunes. Crucially, unlike Nancy, O’Neill has the experience and wherewithal to comprehend this unusual football environment.
