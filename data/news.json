Liverpool simply stood off Reed, almost daring the midfielder to shoot, and were made to regret their lack of urgency when one of Fulham’s more unfashionable players rescued a point for Marco Silva’s stubborn side by ripping a stunning shot into Alisson Becker’s top corner.

By the 78th minute, when a corner was dropped for Malick Thiaw to poke the ball past Dean Henderson, the disappointment writ large across Oliver Glasner’s face suggested the Crystal Palace manager knew the game was up.
