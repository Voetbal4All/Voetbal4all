Deze keer gaan we terug naar augustus 1999, als VI’s Frans van den Nieuwenhof uitgebreid aan tafel gaat zitten met Fred Grim. De doelman zit dan al vijf jaar bij Ajax, heeft met de Amsterdammers alles gewonnen wat er te winnen valt, maar wél steeds als reserve. Door het vertrek van Edwin van der Sar naar Juventus is hij eindelijk de nummer 1 onder de lat. Een boeiend gesprek met de toekomstige (interim-)trainer van Ajax.",

He has stumbled into a fight he cannot win. It did not go down well with Chelsea when Maresca lobbed a grenade into the mix by talking about not being supported enough after last Saturday’s humdrum win against Everton and it is hard not to read his refusal to defuse the situation since then as the stance of a man daring his bosses to act. Chelsea remain bemused by their head coach creating speculation that he has issues with the club’s hierarchy by saying that the 48 hours before the Everton game had been his worst since joining the club. Sources say the outburst even caught people close to Maresca by surprise. Confusion reigns. It does not help that Maresca has publicly and privately rejected repeated opportunities to explain the source of his discontent, leaving it open for outsiders to assume that the Italian’s issues are with Chelsea’s hierarchy.

It is not a “quick fix,” he added. And nobody was about to disagree.
