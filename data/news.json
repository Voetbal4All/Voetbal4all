Only three teams have previously lost 10 Premier League matches in succession. Each of them finished rock-bottom come May. It had been a week of change and tragedy at Molineux. Jeff Shi, an unpopular club chair who recently described relegation as a “technicality”, departed on Friday, replaced by Nathan Shi, the interim appointment a namesake but no relation.
