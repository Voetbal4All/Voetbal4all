These two teams have scooped up four of the last five scudetti between them – with two each – and their rivalry is now among Serie A’s hottest. Inter lead the way this season on 42 points but Napoli, in fourth, are only four points behind. Milan, Roma and Juventus will all think they still have a chance of competing for the title too. Inter and Napoli’s first meeting this season was certainly eventful. Kevin De Bruyne put Antonio Conte’s side ahead from the penalty spot but tore his hamstring in the process. Scott McTominay’s second-half strike was a beauty and set Napoli on their way to a 3-1 win. Can they repeat the feat at San Siro tonight? Continue reading...",

      "summary": "Liverpool forward will face his former teammate Sadio Mané in Afcon semi against Senegal after arguably the Pharaohs’ best performance since 2008 It is a long time since Egypt had a night this good. There have been two World Cup qualifications since their golden age of three successive Cups of Nations came to an end in 2010, and they’ve got to the finals of two Cups of Nations since, but this had a different feel to the knockout phases in 2017 or 2021 (played in 2022). This wasn’t grinding through, doing just enough (across the knockouts in 2017 and 2021, Egypt won one game without needing extra time or penalties; a grim 1-0 against Morocco in the 2017 quarter-final). It was taking on one of the giants of African football and beating them well. A 3-2 victory over Côte d’Ivoire was probably Egypt’s best single performance since they beat the same opposition 4-1 in the semi-finals of Ghana 2008. That game in Kumasi was always going to cast its shadow over this quarter-final. Saturday’s coaches were on opposite sides when Egypt beat Côte d’Ivoire on penalties in the 2006 final in Cairo – Hossam Hassan as a 39-year-old squad captain and unused sub and Émerse Faé in the centre of midfield – but it was the semi-final two years later this game most resembled. The 4-1 hurt Côte d’Ivoire far more than the final had, the image of a bewildered Kolo Touré running away from Amr Zaki as he scored Egypt’s third a symbol of the Pharaohs’ superiority that night. Within four minutes on Saturday, Odilon Kossounou had got in a similar mess, legs tangled as Omar Marmoush sped by him to put Egypt ahead. Continue reading...",
