Frank Lampard – having been abused throughout the match by the home supporters – gestured multiple times at the Saints fans after the match to spark a melee on the pitch. Tatsuhiro Sakamoto and the first-choice centre-backs, Bobby Thomas and Liam Kitching, all missed the game with a flu bug and Jay Dasilva was sent off 85 seconds into the second half. Ephron Mason-Clark had given the Sky Blues a first-half lead but they could not hold out as Nathan Wood levelled after the break. This story will be updated Continue reading...",
