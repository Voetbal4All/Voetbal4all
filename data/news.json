The head coach became increasingly open that something was amiss after chats with Jason Wilcox. The director of football has not covered himself in glory at the club, but he and the chief executive, Omar Berrada, remain while another head coach departs. Conversations with potential replacements need to centre on everyone being on the same page. There were disagreements over tactics and recruitment, which created tension Old Trafford could ill afford.

Season-by-season ambitions should be set, allowing everyone to be held accountable, instead of the blame being foisted on one man. Continue reading...",
