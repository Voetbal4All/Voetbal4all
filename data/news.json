Newcastle almost stopped playing after going two goals ahead inside seven minutes and spent the remainder of the game desperately holding on for their second away win of the season, leaving Burnley wondering what more they could have done. Burnley were dominant in all areas after the early shock, showing the spirit and grit required in a relegation battle, but the truth of the matter is they have two points from the last possible 30 and are facing an immediate return to the Championship. Josh Laurent ignited hope when there was none after Joelinton and Yoane Wissa scored, a flame that was finally put out by Bruno Guimarães late on. Continue reading...",

There was open dissent from the Stamford Bridge crowd when Cole Palmer, who is still feeling his way back from a groin injury, went off midway through the second half and there was more grumbling when a wild game was over. This was another bad night for Chelsea. Maresca’s erratic side defended poorly, have one win in their past seven league games and remain incapable of capitalising on dominant spells. They have now dropped 13 points from winning positions at home – more than any other side in the Premier League – after being held by Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth, who ended grateful to Antoine Semenyo giving his all in what might be his final appearance for the club before a likely move to Manchester City.

      "summary": "Things are beginning to get a little twitchy for Nottingham Forest and Sean Dyche. Forest have made strides under Ange Postecoglou’s successor but after a miserable defeat by Everton, Dyche’s previous club, it is now three straight defeats and a bruising January run of fixtures are on the horizon. Five of their next six matches are away, including a trip to West Ham, now only four points behind Forest. For David Moyes and his threadbare squad, this was a triumph, goals by the former Forest loanee James Garner and Thierno Barry earning a deserved victory. Forest submitted a complaint to Professional Game Match Officials, the referees’ body, regarding the officiating in the defeat at home by Manchester City at the weekend. The club were adamant significant decisions counted against them and requested the audio between on-pitch officials that determined key moments. But Forest only had themselves to blame for a lethargic start against an Everton side that arrived without a victory or even a goal since the reverse fixture at Hill Dickinson Stadium almost four weeks ago.
