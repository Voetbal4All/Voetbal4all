Robertson assisted the decisive goal in the first European Cup triumph in 1979 and scored the decisive goal in the second, contributions that mark him out as one of the most remarkable players in British football history. He earned 28 Scotland caps, notably scoring the winning goal in a Home Championship victory over England at Wembley in May 1981. Clough described him as “the Picasso of our game”.
