      "summary": "Spurs sign Julie Blakstad after bringing in Hanna Wijk Arsenal sign Sweden right-back Smilla Holmberg Leicester are poised to sign the experienced full-back Ashleigh Neville from their fellow Women’s Super League club Tottenham, the Guardian understands, after the north London club completed deals for Julie Blakstad and Hanna Wijk. According to sources, an agreement has been reached for Neville’s move. Tottenham on Monday announced the signing of the Norway international Blakstad on as free transfer, after her contract expired at Hammarby. The 24-year-old former Manchester City player can operate as a winger, wing-back or left-back. Neville is Tottenham’s longest-serving player, having been with the club for eight and a half years, and has been a core part of their side since promotion to the second tier in 2017. A fans’ favourite, she became in February 2025 the first player to make 100 WSL appearances for Tottenham and was a key part of the side that reached the club’s first Women’s FA Cup final in 2024. Neville’s switch to Rick Passmoor’s Leicester is expected to bring regular starting opportunities after Tottenham also signed the Sweden full-back Wijk. The 22-year-old Wijk can, like Neville, play at left-back or right-back and Tottenham are evolving their squad. Leicester are understood to be targeting players with more WSL experience, having often had the youngest average age in the division in their starting side this season. Continue reading...",

For Mason there was the added baggage of Spurs’ 13-year trophy drought; for McFarlane, making his senior management debut, it was Chelsea’s astonishingly bad recent record against Manchester City. Four and a half years have passed since Chelsea last beat Guardiola’s side, when Thomas Tuchel’s team triumphed in the Champions League final, and a draw on Sunday took that winless run to 12 matches. But Enzo Fernández’s injury-time equaliser, combining with the midweek upheaval at Stamford Bridge, made it a triumphant point, something Enzo Maresca didn’t achieve against City during his tenure.

African sides came no closer to really challenging at a World Cup, but the range of teams capable of beating the continent’s elite, of getting to the knockout stage of the Cup of Nations, was becoming more diverse. Perhaps, though, a new phase is beginning. It’s dangerous always to read too much into the performance of one side at one tournament, but in Qatar in 2022 Morocco at last broke through the quarter-final barrier and became the first African side to reach a World Cup semi-final. And now, in the Cup of Nations Morocco are hosting, the traditional powers are reasserting themselves. There is yet to be a real surprise in the tournament and, halfway through the round of 16, the prospect is of the highest-powered list of quarter-finalists in history. Continue reading...",
