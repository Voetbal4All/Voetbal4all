Ruben Amorim also brings back Patrick Dorgu, which suggests he’s sticking with his much-disliked formation. Could anyone make sense of the 4-4 farrago last Monday?

They departed as the latest victims of the Hearts juggernaut. Back to back wins against Celtic had already been secured before Hearts repeated the trick against Rangers. Dreams of a first Hearts title since 1960 are not merely alive. They are growing. Rangers are a dozen points adrift of Derek McInnes’s team after this, a first away league defeat of 2025. Hearts are 18 games and halfway towards the promised land. Rangers had arguably been the better side before Hearts whacked them with two, decisive first-half goals. Stuart Findlay claimed the first of them, the centre back rising highest after Alexandros Kyziridis combined with Claudio Braga for a short corner. Kyziridis’s cross was pinpoint.
