Leandro Trossard added a third with 20 minutes to go before the substitute Gabriel Jesus rubbed salt in Aston Villa’s wounds to compound their first defeat in 12 matches and leave them six points adrift of the leaders in third.

Yet Ruben Amorim’s side struggled – badly – and while Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire headed those unavailable, the display provokes questions regarding United’s cohesion. In the contest’s closing phase they were potent only sporadically – as throughout. Their opening-half goal was a fortunate one for Joshua Zirkzee, rebounding in off Ladislav Krejci, and after the Czech’s equaliser just before the interval, Wolves might have recorded a first – and famous – victory of the season.

All the glory was Newcastle’s, the points that took them up to 10th secured and the performance did not matter. Burnley deserved more but once again were left with nothing, except a feeling of resignation to their fate. Within seven minutes Joelinton and Yoane Wissa had given the visitors a two-goal lead, and ­Newcastle’s travelling woes looked a distant memory. Considering Burnley’s own recent form a comeback looked highly unlikely but Eddie Howe’s side are fragile, not knowing what to do with a lead nor how to control a game against a team who have ­collected two points from 10 games. Josh Laurent’s volley ignited hope, a flame that was finally extinguished by ­Guimarães in injury time. Continue reading...",
