A loan signing or two could be on the cards, however, with Arsenal not having filled either slot so far after bringing in Neto from Bournemouth and Raheem Sterling from Chelsea last season. Mikel Arteta could do with more cover at right-back and must also decide whether to allow Ethan Nwaneri to go on loan with the 18-year-old having made only three starts in all competitions.

For those in academy football, it can often be make or break. While the very best – such as Arsenal’s record-breaking Max Dowman, who made headlines in October when he agreed terms on a scholarship deal – secured their futures in good time, many discovered their fates just before the 31 December deadline. “It’s always the sort of classic breakup. It’s not you, it’s us,” says Dr Chris Platts, who has studied the academy system for more than a decade and offers support to young players and their families. “Being released before Christmas isn’t nice for a kid.

Those scratchy wins over Wolves, Everton and Brighton can now be celebrated alongside a champagne evening to sign off 2025. The club’s familiarity with chasing the title as the league turns for home has bred an unavoidable anxiety. April and May have previously proved the cruellest months but December has been full of worries. In pre-match, “north London forever” was sung tremulously, fans seeking a collective warmth to ward off individual doubts about the dream. For 45 minutes, fans, players and manager alike were left alone with their private agonies, only for the second half where Arsenal played the expansive, confident football of the autumn, smashing in four goals to vaporise the unease.
