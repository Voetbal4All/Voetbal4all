      "summary": "Dave Kwakman stond op het punt om door AZ aan FC Volendam verhuurd te worden, maar vooralsnog hebben de Alkmaarders de deal van de 21-jarige middenvelder geblokkeerd. 'Dave heeft zich slecht gepresenteerd bij de looptest gisteren', legt technisch directeur Max Huiberts van AZ uit. 'Misschien dat hij met zijn hoofd al ergens anders heeft gezeten. Maar hier werden we niet blij van. Zolang je onderdeel van AZ bent, moet je hier je best doen. We houden Dave hier. Dit is de niet de manier om weg te gaan bij AZ.' Huiberts sluit niet uit dat het later deze maand alsnog tot een verhuur komt van Kwakman, die in de eerst competitiehelft slechts 103 minuten speelde. In dat geval zal Kasper Boogaard zijn plek in de selectie innemen. Wie zaterdag ontbrak bij de eerste groepstraining van AZ van 2026 was Lequincio Zeefuik. De 21-jarige aanvaller sprak zaterdag met een van de clubs die in hem geïnteresseerd is.",

There’s more of a confidence and belief but that’s only going to come from more results and more performances and being more consistent with what we do. There are certainly certain things that we’ve improved on, but it’s a difficult league, and we came in at a difficult moment, so it was always going to be hard to instantly get those results.

Ollie Watkins celebrated his 250th appearance for the club with his fourth goal in three games and John McGinn added two more as Unai Emery’s side won their 11th straight home game. Villa’s ability to score out of next to nothing epitomises their season. They managed this game superbly, inflicting a fourth straight defeat on Nottingham Forest, but if the league table was made up of their expected goals difference, they would have started this weekend in 15th place.

This marked a sixth defeat in eight games for Nancy. It arrived against the backdrop of revolt from paying customers. Celtic feel an on- and off-field mess. Nancy is on the precipice.
