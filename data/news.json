With a contract at Bournemouth containing a £65m release clause that becomes active for the first two weeks of January, Manchester City appear to have won the race for the player who has scored 19 Premier League goals since the start of last season. Chelsea and Tottenham have now moved on to other targets but could Liverpool or Manchester United attempt to steal a late march on their rivals? They need to get a move on if so.

Ever since Aston Villa ended a four-match losing streak against them with a 1-0 home win in December 2023, Emery has proved to be a thorn in Mikel Arteta’s side. Villa’s 2-0 victory at the Emirates a few months later ultimately cost Arsenal the title as a relentless Manchester City took advantage by winning their last eight matches. Arsenal had an impressive 2-0 triumph in Birmingham at the start of last season, but Villa’s comeback from two goals down to draw 2-2 in January of this year was symptomatic of Arsenal’s failure to chase down Liverpool in the title race that never was.
