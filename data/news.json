West Ham are interested in Wolves’s Jørgen Strand Larsen but are reluctant to meet his valuation. It is believed that Wolves, who are bottom of the Premier League, want £40m for the Norwegian. West Ham’s budget is limited and they feel that the package for Strand Larsen, who has scored once in the league this season, is too expensive. Continue reading...",

It had already been a worthy showpiece to draw the curtains on pre-Christmas Bundesliga but the end result – achieved not without a smidgeon of controversy – left us with a satisfying tale to tell by an open fire over holiday season. Bayer Leverkusen can enjoy their brief break with a rosy glow of satisfaction with their win against a direct competitor a clear measure of how far they have come; or, if you like, a measure of how far Kasper Hjulmand has taken them.
