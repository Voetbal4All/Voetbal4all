We’re a week into the Africa Cup of Nations now and really getting down to business. Tonight, two of the continent’s heavyweights meet in Marrakech as the reigning champions, Côte d’Ivoire, take on Cameroon in Group F. Both teams won their opening match 1-0 on Christmas Eve and, realistically, this is a showdown for top spot in the group – though Mozambique will have something to say after beating Gabon earlier today. Don’t ask me about permutations but, with the four best third-placed teams also heading to the last 16, a draw tonight will all but guarantee both teams’ progression to the knockouts.

After a mixed start to life in north London, Archie Gray could not have picked a better occasion to score his first Tottenham goal since joining from Leeds in the summer of 2024 than his 60th appearance. With Thomas Frank already showing signs of not being the first Spurs manager to have been overwhelmed by expectations after a run of just one win in their previous eight Premier League matches, Gray’s scrappy header in the first half ensured that a topsy-turvy year ended with a victory that lifts his side to within one point of Crystal Palace in the table. Of the 20 goals that Oliver Glasner’s side have conceded this season in the league, 12 have come from set-pieces and Palace have now failed to win any of their last five matches as a packed schedule has finally caught up with them.
